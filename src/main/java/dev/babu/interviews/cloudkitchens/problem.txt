interface MenuStream {

     String readLine();

}
There is a continuous stream of menu items. Read using the above interface and construct objects of
Menu items. The item type could be DISH, SOUP, INGREDIENT. Ingredient does not have a price. After the
line which contains price, there would be other line items which are menu item themselves. Each distinct
menu is separated by an empty line. You should keep reading the line and build MenuItem objects until you
hit null when you call readLine().

Here is part of the menu stream:

1
Lasagna
Entree
13.00
